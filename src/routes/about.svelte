<h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Jeanella Klarys Pascual</h1>

<p>
  I am a 30 year-old Front-end Developer, based in Lille ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. 
  In Autumn of 2015, I moved from my sunny home country of the Philippines to France and have been living here ever since.
</p>

<p>I'm currently pursuing a <a href="https://mastertcloc.unistra.fr/">Masters in Technical Communication and Localization from the University of Strasbourg</a>. 
I graduated Computer Science from the University of the Philippines in 2013.</p>

<p>When I am not burning the midnight oil coding, I like to curl up in my bed and read books (The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy series, Exhalation by Ted Chiang among my favorites), paint with watercolors, experiment with international cuisine, and write on my journal. Before the pandemic, I also loved solo traveling around Europe.</p>

<p>I'm a huge fan of languages, having achieved C1/C2 in French. I'm currently pursuing Mandarin and Danish, and dream of studying Faroese at the <a class="link" href="https://www.setur.fo/en/education/faroese-summer-institute/">Faroese Summer Institute</a>.</p>

<p>Other things I really like: landscapes, starry skies, knitted wear, milk tea, cats, sci-fi.</p>
