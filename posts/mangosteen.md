Mangosteen had always brought memories of my childhood back in Mindanao. There, fruits were abundant, accessible, and were always fresh.

The outer skin of the Mangosteen is thick, shiny, and very sturdy. The inner skin is fleshy with juice that could stain clothes. The skin constitutes a significant portion of the weight which makes the fruit a little pricey.

The pulp is tender, and has a tangy but sweet taste. I've yet to see the actual tree that it grows from.
