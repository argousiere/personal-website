No other season marks the arrival of a new chapter quite as symbolically as that of Autumn.

The landscape shifts from the greens of the trees into a burst of reds, yellows, and oranges, a short-lived panorama of warm colors, before the north winds render the land brown and barren. The long days of summer starts to take up speed, and it is during this time where daylight savings shifts everybody's clock 1 hour earlier for the next 6 months.

My idea of Autumn came straight out of childrens' storybooks, movies, and Koreanovelas (back when it was all the rage in my country), and I always imagined it to be like a fairy tale.

Wild berries, nuts, foxes, mushrooms, forests, leaf-covered walkways. Stuff that Autumn is made of.

Little mushrooms with big red caps and white spots on them! How adorable are they? I could have sworn I heard fairy bells ring while walking in the woods.


The forests are alive with the infusion of pine and mushroom scents. And the scenery prepares itself for the arrival of winter.


I can't wait to experience it again next year.
